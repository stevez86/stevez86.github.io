            My name is Steve Zimmerman and I'd like to welcome you to my webpage. This site was created when I started Phase 0 of my education at <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp (DBC)</a>. DBC is a 19-week intensive curriculum that transforms beginners into full-stack web developers. DBC focuses primarily on Ruby, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, common JavaScript libraries, SQL, HTML and CSS, as well as pair programming, and agile and test driven development. Throughout my journey through Phase 0 and beyond, I will be blogging about my expereinces. Those entries can be found on yhe blog portion of this website.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>I was born and raised in Houston, Texas. I was a curious kid with a knack for building and discovering things. Not long after getting a computer for Christmas did my passion for computers begin to grow. This passion became my primary hobbie and I was building computers and programming games on my own. This led to courses in high school and a summer camp at Brown University.</p>
            <p>Following high school, I attended Purdue University in Indiana where I studied Mechanical Engineering. While pursuing my education at Purdue I took extra courses in Computer Science, but nothing really came of it due to the teaching style and focusing on my primary degree in Engineering.</p>
            <p>After graduating with my degree in Mechanical Engineering, I moved to Chicago, IL and began working in multiple industries including nuclear power generation, technical sales and insurance consulting. After gaining years of diverse work experience utilizing my engineering degree, I realized that my true passion was not strictly in Engineering but in computers and therefore I decided to make a career advancement to become a software engineer and attend Dev Bootcamp in San Francisco.</p>
            <h2>Purdue University</h2>
            <p><img id="puimg" src="imgs/Purdue-img.jpg"/>
            Purdue University, located in West Lafayette, Indiana, is the flagship university of the six-campus Purdue University system. Purdue was founded on May 6, 1869, as a land-grant university when the Indiana General Assembly, taking advantage of the Morrill Act, accepted a donation of land and money from Lafayette businessman John Purdue to establish a college of science, technology, and agriculture in his name. The first classes were held on September 16, 1874, with six instructors and 39 students.</p>
            <h2>Chicago, IL</h2>

Its metropolitan area, sometimes called Chicagoland, is home to 9.5 million people and is the third-largest in the United States. Chicago is the seat of Cook County.</p>
            <h2>Houston, TX</h2>
