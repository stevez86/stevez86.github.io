            My name is Steve Zimmerman and I'd like to welcome you to my webpage. This site was created when I started Phase 0 of my education at <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp (DBC)</a>. DBC is a 19-week intensive curriculum that transforms beginners into full-stack web developers. DBC focuses primarily on Ruby, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, common JavaScript libraries, SQL, HTML and CSS, as well as pair programming, teamwork and agile and test driven development. Throughout my journey through Phase 0 and beyond, I will be blogging about my experiences. Those entries can be found on the blog portion of this website.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>I was born and raised in Houston, Texas. I was a curious kid with a knack for building and discovering things. Not long after getting a computer for Christmas, my passion for computers began to grow. This passion became my primary hobby and I was building computers and programming games for fun, in no time. This led to taking some programming courses in high school and a summer course at Brown University.</p>
            <p><img id="puimg" src="imgs/Purdue-img.jpg"/>Following high school, I attended Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana where I studied Mechanical Engineering. While pursuing my education at Purdue, I took additional courses in Computer Science, but due to a primary focus on Engineering, nothing really came of it.</p>
            <p>After graduating with my degree in Mechanical Engineering, I moved to Chicago, IL where I began working for Exelon at a Nuclear Power Plant. This work was an amazing, hands-on experience and I learned a lot of valuable things that you can only get working at a heavily regulated nuclear facility. Due to the rural location of the powerplant, I decided to explore opportunities closer to the city of Chicago, where I took jobs as an Applications Engineer for Interlake Mecalux and a Technical Consultant for LWG Consulting. Over the years while working, my interest for computers and technology remained and I was building personal servers and following the tech industry very closely in my spare time.</p>
            <p>After gaining valuable experience utilizing my engineering degree, I realized that I wanted to follow my true passion and therefore I decided to make a career advancement, move to San Francisco and start a new career as a web developer by attending Dev Bootcamp.</p>
            <p>During my education at DBC, I re-discovered my passion for learning and creativity and I'm confident that I can rapidly learn any new programming language and apply it to make useful things. DBC has taught be how to become a world class beginner and a world class learner and has given me the confidence to succeed in difficult and confusing challenges. I hope to take these skills to an innovative technology company that encourages rapid learning for all its employees.</p>
