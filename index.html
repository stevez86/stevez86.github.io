            My name is Steve Zimmerman and I'd like to welcome you to my webpage where you can learn more about me and all my awesomeness! I was born and raised in Houston, Texas. Following high school, I attended Purdue University in Indiana where I studied Mechanical Engineering. After Graduation, I moved to Chicago, IL to and began working in multiple industries. Following several years in diverse industries I decided to make career advancement to become a software engineer and attend Dev Bootcamp. Join me on my journey over the next few months!</p>

            Purdue University, located in West Lafayette, Indiana, is the flagship university of the six-campus Purdue University system. Purdue was founded on May 6, 1869, as a land-grant university when the Indiana General Assembly, taking advantage of the Morrill Act, accepted a donation of land and money from Lafayette businessman John Purdue to establish a college of science, technology, and agriculture in his name. The first classes were held on September 16, 1874, with six instructors and 39 students.</p>
