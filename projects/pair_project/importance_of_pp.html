            <p>Pair Programming is an important part of the culture and teaching style of DBC because everyone learns better by                   teaching and mentoring. Additionally, pair programming and Agile Development are increasingly common in software                   development in general and pretty standard for Ruby on Rails jobs. It is also likely to be part of the interview                   process.</p>
