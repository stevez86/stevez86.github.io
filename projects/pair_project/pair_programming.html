            <p>Pair programming is a collaborative teamwork between two developers. During pair programming, developers exchange                  ideas and complete a given task collaboratively. Typically, one programmer takes the roll of the driver whilst the                 other is the navigator. For more information on the difference between the navigator role and the driver role please                visit our page on <a href="compare_nav_driver.html">Comparing Navigator and Driver</a>.</p>
