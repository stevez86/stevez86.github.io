Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience? What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?

# We're all in this together
#### 9/19/14

After watching the video, Shereef's Fireside Chat, I gained an understanding that the DBC experience is a relationship with owning my education and career that'll last a lifetime. I was moved about the mindset of empowering yourself to take charge of your education, the true passion of ownership. The comparison between being a consumer vs a creator in the video really hit home, as it’s so common in our current culture to purchase an item and it’ll do the work for me, whereas my mindset needs to be, “we’re all in this together.”

I think I need to come into this with the creator mindset, not judgmental and take ownership of my education. I may be guilty of thinking Dev Bootcamp will give me the “certification” to be a web developer, however after watching the video, I realize that I’m nervous that I’ll have the wrong mindset but need to prep myself with a positive open mindset. My expectations haven’t necessarily changed, before applying, I did my research and knew what I was getting into however the video reinforced my understanding and the need for that “right” mindset moving forward.

I’m confident that at DevBootcamp the students and teachers will all have a positive growth mindset and will be encouraging and teaching each other. I’m excited to participate in person and in the hangouts leading up to phase 1 and I’m nervous that I’m an “imposter” and don't deserve to be at DBC, however the video gave me a positive outlook and I believe I can control my mindset moving forward.

Some other take aways that I learned from the video are the constant evolution of the class itself and it’s growth mindset. The constant feedback goes both ways and I appreciate that the class demonstrates what they preach, it makes the experience more authentic and easier to buy into.
