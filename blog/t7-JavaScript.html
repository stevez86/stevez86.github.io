            <h2>JavaScript vs Ruby</h2>
            <p><i>Friday, October 31st, 2014</i></p>
            <p>For this week's technical blog, I decided to write about something we are learning and to explain the differences between Ruby and JavaScript. Having spent a few weeks with Ruby and this week learning JavaScript, I have a basic understanding of the similarities and differences. Both languages in general are of higher level and are relatively forgiving. Javascript is used by the browser and is known by it's compatibiliity to run on any machine. Another difference has to do with syntax, such as using semi colons for end of lines. Syntax of functions in JS are very different than Ruby. Both languages are very forgiving. As an example below, the differences between how one would print to the console are shown.</p>

            <blockquote>
            <b>Ruby:</b>
            <br>def mymethod
            <br>&nbsp&nbspputs "hi"
            <br>end
            <br><br><b>JavaScript:</b>
            <br>function myfunction() {
            <br>&nbsp&nbspconsole.log("hi");
            <br>}</blockquote>

            <p>As you can see the syntax is different. As for Objects, they are available in both languages but with different syntax. Properties can be modified as similar between the two. Both languages can also be object oriented meaning objects and variables can be limited in scope. Those are some of the differences between JavaScript and Ruby.</p>
