            <h2>JavaScript vs Ruby</h2>
            <p><i>Friday, October 31st, 2014</i></p>
            <p>For this week's technical blog, I've been tasked with explaining the differences between Ruby and JavaScript. Having spent a few weeks with Ruby and this week learning JavaScript, I have a decent understanding of the similarities and differences. Both languages in general are of higher level and are relatively forgiving. Most the differences between the two have to do with syntax. Such as using semi colons for end of lines. Syntax of functions in JS vs methods in Ruby and and one prints to the console, example below below</p>

            <blockquote>
            <b>Ruby:</b>
            <br>def mymethod
            <br>&nbsp&nbspputs "hi"
            <br>end
            <br><br><b>JavaScript:</b>
            <br>function myfunction() {
            <br>&nbsp&nbspconsole.log("hi");
            <br>}</blockquote>

            <p>As you can see the uses of "end" and the brackets differ. As for Objects, they are available in both languages but with different syntax. Properties can be modified as similar between the two. Both languages can also be object oriented meaning objects and variables can be limited in scope. Those are some of the differences between JavaScript and Ruby.</p>
