            <p>9/19/14</p>
            <p>This is my first blog entry and part of a series I will be doing prior to starting at Dev Bootcamp (DBC). For this week we were asked to watch a video on Engineering Empathy and the DBC experience.</p>

            <p>After watching the video, Shereef's Fireside Chat, I gained an understanding that the DBC experience is a relationship with owning my education and career that'll last a lifetime. I was moved about the mindset of empowering yourself to take charge of your education, the true passion of ownership. The comparison between being a consumer vs a creator in the video really hit home, as it's so common in our consumer culture that DBC could easily be confused as a product, that, if I just put enough time in money I will get a degree back, whereas my mindset needs to be, own your education and take advantage of this opportunity.</p>

            <p>The video inspired me to come into this with that "creator" mindset, not a judgmental one, and take ownership of my education. I may have been guilty of this consumer line of thinking, however after watching the video, I realize that my mindset needed to change. My expectations haven't necessarily changed, before applying, I did my research and knew what I was getting into however the video reinforced my understanding and the need for that right mindset moving forward.</p>

            <p>In addition to myself, I'm confident that at DevBootcamp the students and teachers will all have a positive growth mindset that will be encouraging. I'm excited to participate in person and I realize that I need to be aware of common traps when learning at a rapid pace such as "imposter syndrome."</p>

            <p>Some other take aways that I learned from the video are the constant evolution of the class itself and it's growth mindset. The constant feedback goes both ways and I appreciate that the class demonstrates what they preach, it makes the experience more authentic and easier to buy into.</p>

            <p>Overall, I'm excited about going into DBC with my cohort and taking our education and career into our own hands</p>
