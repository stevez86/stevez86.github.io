            <h2>Baby Steps</h2>
            <p><i>Friday, October 10th, 2014</i></p>
            <p>For this week's cultural topic, I decided to discuss an issue facing the tech world today. I chose to discuss capitalism along with science and technology, and innovation.</p>
            <p>Peter Thiel, co founder and CEO of Paypal, recently said that the U.S. is more focused on capitalism thantechnology. Using hollywood movies such as Gravity, where technology fails as an example, Peter explained that there is a negative bias against technology, with exceptions being mobile and the internet. </p>

            <p>I think this is an interesting observation and could be viewed as a problem or as a society that has high standards. Either way, I think it's and an important issue facing the tech industry because it forces the tech industry to improve people's lives in order to be relevant. The negative bias stems from people seeing mostly tech failures among few successes. I think in order to stand out in the tech industry, just like any industry, you have to bring value to someone's life and make it pleasant for the user. With the advent of the internet, there is insane competition and survival requires being unique and standing out and doing that for years. For the tech industry, this is a problem, only few companies can reach the critical mass to bring adoption to the masses. </p>

            <p>The smartphone wasn't invented by Apple or Google, but Apple and Google made the smartphone enjoyable and beneficial for the individual. These two companies were able to bring the smartphone beyond the critical mass, making them accessible to the masses and creating a system allowing developers to innovate. I think in order for something to be successful in the tech world, that critical mass has to be reached and with a super competitive environment this is extremely difficult. This and the fact that the user is over stimulated with competition there is a real difficulty with becoming successful. </p>

            <p>I think this over stimulation is a problem because people who don't grow up with a certain technology become alienated to change could potentially have a negative bias against new technology. This is a problem for the tech industry on the macro level and it will take real advancements and the help of leading tech companies, tapping those startup companies it deems worthy and leveraging economies of scale before new technologies become successful and adopted by the masses. The internet as we know it now hasn't even been around 30 years. Try to image the car when it was 30 years old in the 1930s. The tech industry is still in its infancy and in order to grow it needs to take baby steps.</p>
