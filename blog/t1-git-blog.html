            <h2>Welcome to Github</h2>

            <p><i>Tuesday, September 19th, 2014</i></p>

            <p>Welcome, to all my classmates, it looks like we are going to be taking this plunge into programming together. This time I'll be writing about a couple things that I just learned about. It's interesting how DBC is already tasking us with teaching the things we learn back to the class. So enjoy my first blog entry...</p>

            <p>Github is one of the things taught during the first week at DevBootcamp. We use github and repositories to track git changes to projects. Git is a software system that allows collaboration through version control on team projects that may include many files and many team members. Version control prevents people working on the same projects from having conflicts when editing files within the same project. It basically keeps tracks of changes and provides a peer review system called merging that protects the integrity of the entire project.</p>

            <p>Github is a website that implements git to its members and allows collaboration on team projects through git. Developers use git to track and manage changes to a program so that multiple people can collaborate on a project together without having to worry about the complexity of versions and someone changing a piece of code that could affect or damage work done by another team member as potentially the same time. As you can imagine, tracking changes and implementing them systematically is very important when working on projects, partiualrly large ones with many team members.</p>
