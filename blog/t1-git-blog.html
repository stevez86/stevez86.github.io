            <h2>Lessons by Steve: Welcome to the world of programming, Github Style</h2>

            <p>9/19/14</p>

            <p>Welcome, as one newbie to another, it looks like we are going to be taking this plunge into programming together. I've been tasked with writing about a couple things that I just learned about, these writing tasks seem to be github flavored as that's about all I am capable of "teaching" about anyways. So enjoy my first blog entry...</p>

            <p>Github is one of the things taught during the first week at DevBootcamp. It's funny how they are already tasking me with teaching it right back. It's interesting to say the least. We use github and repositories to track git changes to projects. Git is a software system that allows collaboration through version control on team projects that may include many files and many team members. Version control prevents people working on the same projects from having conflicts when editing files within the same project. It basically keeps tracks of changes and provides a peer review system called merging that protects the integrity of the entire project.</p>

            <p>Github is a website or a central database that implements git to its members and allows collaboration on team projects through git. Developers use git to track and manage changes to a program so that multiple people can collaborate on a project together without having to worry about the complexity of versions and someone changing a piece of code that could affect or damage work done by another team member as potentially the same time. As you can imagine, tracking changes and implemting them systematically is very important when working on projects, partiualrly large ones with many team members.</p>

            <p>I look forward to learning more about git and github and then blogging about it. Steve here, signing off on our first blog. Goodluck to everyone, I hope I make it through week 2!</p>
