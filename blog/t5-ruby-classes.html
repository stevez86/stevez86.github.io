            <h2>Usefulness of Ruby Classes</h2>
            <p><i>Friday, October 17th, 2014</i></p>
            <p>For this week's technical blog, I decided to write about how ruby classes can be used to model real life objects. One real-life case where ruby classes would be useful is with modeling a deck of cards. According to the ruby docs, classes in Ruby are first-class objects, meaning each is an instance of class 'Class'. They are created with the following code:</p>

            <blockquote>class CardDeck<br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspdef initialize<br>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp # code to initialize the class<br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp end<br>
            end</blockquote>

            <p>When a new class is created, an object of type Class is initialized and assigned to a global constant (CardDeck in this case). When CardDeck.new is called to create a new object, the new method is run by default. For my example of a card deck, one could create a card deck, initialize each card in order with suits and the card value, create methods to shuffle the deck, return a card (either from a certain position or the next position), initialize it for a specific game that may not use all the cards of a deck, initialize it for a deck that may have certain wild cards, etc, initialize it as a deck that's actually made up of multiple decks (ex. Blackjack).</p>

            <p>Creating a class for a carddeck would be beneficial for use in coding a card game such as blackjack. One could call a method to return the next card and the management of the card deck can be done by the class allowing the programmer to worry about building the game. The point of a class is to create a system that reduces code overhead and works for you allowing you to focus on the creativity of coding a solution to the problem.</p>
