            <h2>Conflict</h2>
            <p><i>Wednesday, November 5th, 2014</i></p>
            <p>
            For this week's cultural blog, I've been tasked with researching the "compass of shame" and discussin a time when I had an emotional conflict with someone. This week, the questions were given in bullet form and will be answered that way.</p>

            <p><i>1. Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</i></p>
            <blockquote><p> I'd like to discuss a time when there was an emotional conflict between a busines (maids) and myself. It had to do with a miscommunication, they thought they were to clean only a portion of the apartment instead of the whole thing, like I thought I requested. After discussing that they not show before a certain time, the maids on a certain time the maids showed up 2 hours early and cleaned the wrong section of the apartment. After I called them to discuss the disagreement we settled on them coming the next day to clean the rest of the apartment for free (or so I thought). However after they cleaned the rest of the apartment I received a second bill for the second cleaning. After politely discussing this issue I realized there was a miscommunication and kindly mentioned my needs from them (recurring 2 week cleaning) and they proposed a resolution that was suuitable to both them and myself.</p></blockquote>
            <p><i>2. What was the source of the conflict?</i></p>
            <blockquote><p>The source of the conflict was the miscommunication between the managers, cleaners and myself. There was also an english being a second language issue as well</p></blockquote>
            <p><i>3. How did you handle that conflict?</i></p>
            <blockquote><p>After being initally upset, I took a moment and proposed an alternative and we came to an agreement that the apartment  be cleaned in 2 weeks for free and all recurring 2 week cleanings at a discounted rate. We came to this after I realized that there is no point in rehashing all the mistakes due to the miscommunication and realizing that we could both offer each other what the other wanted. We then resolved it and came to an agreeement.</p></blockquote>
            <p><i>4. Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</i></p>
            <blockquote><p>In this case, the actions made the conflict better and resolved it in mine and their eyes.</p></blockquote>
            <p><i>5. If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</i></p>
            <blockquote><p>If I were to go back I would proably make sure the communications to the actually cleaning people were clear, however the end resolution was better than I could have asked for</p></blockquote>
            <p><i>6. What did you learn from this experience?</i></p>
            <blockquote><p>I learned that sometimes disagreements can be turned into a benefit for all parties, that communication is crucial and that there is no point in pointing out all the past things that the company did wrong and just move forward.</p></blockquote>
