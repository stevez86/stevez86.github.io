            <h2>Pairing and Feedback</h2>
            <p><i>Friday, October 17th, 2014</i></p>
            <p>For this week's cultural blog entry, I've been tasked with writing an entry with regards to pairing within Dev Bootcamp. Pairing is a requirement each week where you work through a challenge with a partner going through and coding. This can be done remotely and serves various purposes. One of those important purposes is to familiarize with working with others while coding, like one may do in the workplace. In Dev Bootcamp they have specific roles that are encouraged during a pairing session. These roles include a driver and a navigator. The driver deals with the specific line of code that's being worked on and I refer to the responsibilities of this person as being on the micro-level. The navigator deals with how that line of code fits in the scheme of the whole program and guides the driver at the macro-level. After each of these sessions, partners give each other feedback.</p>

            <p>While pairing with partners various emotions are experienced. Being tasked to write about emotions and feedback, I chose to write about the emotion experienced when one discovers a new way to solve a problem or a trick to code more efficiently. Numerous times during a pairing session, my partner has shared a tip or a new perspective that sets off a trigger in my brain that I like-to the satisfaction of getting paid. This may seem weird, but more than a few times where my partner has given me a tip or a new way to solve a problem, to me this is an added value, which is similar to getting paid. </p>

            <p>This satisfaction is also reflected in the feedback that I've given and received. When someone gives feedback that offers an improvement sometimes it's easy to let it go but after time if you try to incorporate that feedback into your next pairing session then it can be very rewarding much like being paid. Not sure why I'm running with this analogy but I guess it makes sense. Feedback is a sensitive topic for many people so giving constructive feedback can be beneficial to both the giver and the receiver of the feedback. Feedback is crucial and how one receives it is maybe even more important then how one gives it. If you want to improve yourself you need to be able to receive feedback. If you act negatively or get upset, you won't hear or understand the feedback plus the person who gave it will be less likely to give feedback in the future. Here's my point: be careful with your feedback, make sure it's actionable, specific and kind (ASK) and you will go far, and as a receiver, try not to be too sensitive about it. Give it a try!</p>
