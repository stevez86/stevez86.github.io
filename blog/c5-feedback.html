            <h2>Pairing and Feedback</h2>
            <p><i>Friday, October 17th, 2014</i></p>
            <p>For this week's cultural blog entry, I decided to write an entry with regards to pair programming and feedback. Pair programming is where you work through a programming challenge with a partner. This can be done remotely and serves many purposes including becoming familiar with working with others while coding, like some people may do in the workplace. At Dev Bootcamp there are specific roles that are encouraged for each person in the pair. These roles include a driver and a navigator. The driver deals with the specific line of code that's being worked on and I refer to the responsibilities of this person as being on the micro-level. The navigator deals with how that line of code fits in the scheme of the whole program and guides the driver at the macro-level. After each of these sessions, partners give each other feedback.</p>

            <p>While pairing with partners various emotions are experienced. Numerous times during a pairing session, my partner has shared a tip or a new perspective that has helped me personally. Whether it be a sublime shortcut or a new way to solve the problem that may not have occured ot me. This is a great way to learn on the job and gain new abilities. After each pair we are encouraged to give the pair feedback.</p>

            <p>This satisfaction of learning is also reflected in the feedback that I've given and received. When someone gives feedback that offers an improvement sometimes it's easy to let it go but after time if you try to incorporate that feedback into your next pairing session then it can be very rewarding. Feedback is a sensitive topic for many people so giving constructive feedback can be beneficial to both the giver and the receiver of the feedback. Feedback is crucial and how one receives it is maybe even more important then how one gives it. If you want to improve yourself you need to be able to receive feedback. If you act negatively or get upset, you won't hear or understand the feedback, plus the person who gave it will be less likely to give you feedback in the future. Here's my point: be careful with your feedback, make sure it's actionable, specific and kind and you will go far, and as a receiver, try not to be too sensitive about it. Give it a try!</p>
