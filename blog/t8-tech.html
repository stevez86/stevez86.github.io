            <h2>What is Rails?</h2>
            <p><i>Wednesday, November 5th, 2014</i></p>
            <p>For this week's technical blog, I've been tasked with writing about a topic that is new to me, Rails. The last nine weeks I've been introduced to HTML, CSS, Ruby, JavaScript and a whole bunch of new things before moving to SF and putting it all together to become a beginner developer. For this week's blog I chose to write about one thing that's missing so far from my education that I will surely be learning soon, Rails.</p>

            <p>Many people have heard of the term Ruby on Rails and after doing some research have learned a little about what that means. According to www.rubyonrails.org;</p>

            <blockquote><p>Rails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby language. It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started. It allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks. Experienced Rails developers also report that it makes web application development more fun.</p>

            <p>Rails is opinionated software. It makes the assumption that there is the "best" way to do things, and it's designed to encourage that way - and in some cases to discourage alternatives. If you learn "The Rails Way" you'll probably discover a tremendous increase in productivity. If you persist in bringing old habits from other languages to your Rails development, and trying to use patterns you learned elsewhere, you may have a less happy experience.</p></blockquote>

            <p>And from www.tutorialspoint.com;</p>

            <blockquote><p>Rails Strengths:</p>

            <p>Rails is packed with features that make you more productive, with many of the following features building on one other.</p>

            <p>Metaprogramming : Other frameworks use extensive code generation from scratch. Metaprogramming techniques use programs to write programs. Ruby is one of the best languages for metaprogramming, and Rails uses this capability well. Rails also uses code generation but relies much more on metaprogramming for the heavy lifting.</p>

            <p>Active Record : Rails introduces the Active Record framework, which saves objects to the database. The Rails version of Active Record discovers the columns in a database schema and automatically attaches them to your domain objects using metaprogramming.</p>

            <p>Convention over configuration: Most web development frameworks for .NET or Java force you to write pages of configuration code. If you follow suggested naming conventions, Rails doesn't need much configuration.</p>

            <p>Scaffolding: You often create temporary code in the early stages of development to help get an application up quickly and see how major components work together. Rails automatically creates much of the scaffolding you'll need.</p>

            <p>Built-in testing: Rails creates simple automated tests you can then extend. Rails also provides supporting code called harnesses and fixtures that make test cases easier to write and run. Ruby can then execute all your automated tests with the rake utility.</p>

            <p>Three environments: Rails gives you three default environments: development, testing, and production. Each behaves slightly differently, making your entire software development cycle easier. For example, Rails creates a fresh copy of the Test database for each test run.</p></blockquote>

            <p>As far as I can tell with my limited knowledge of Rails and from the research I've done, this explains it pretty well. I look forward to implemting it in the future into new and exciting projects.</p>
