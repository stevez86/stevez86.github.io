            <h2>My Thinking Style</h2>
            <p><i>Sunday, October 5th, 2014</i></p>
            <p>In this blog entry I've been tasked with researching my Gregorc thinking style. The quiz groups everyone into one of 4 thinking styles such as Concrete Sequential, Abstract Sequential, Abstract Random or Concrete Random. After taking the quiz a few times, I found that I am equally Abstract Sequential as Concrete Random. Now if you're asking how can one have equal traits in all 4 of the options, well I'm with you. After doing some research, I realized that they are both similar and describe me pretty accurately.</p>

            <p>The following is the summary of Gregorc's findings. In the thinking styles there are two perceptual qualities, Concrete and Abstract. Concrete is something you can sense and is tangible. Abstract is something thought up and visualized. Gregorc also groups everyone into two ordering abilities, Sequential and Random. Sequential allows one to order everything in a linear fashion through step by step while random allows your mind to organize information into chunks where tackling the information is in no particular linear order.</p>

            <p>Not only is it important to understand other people's thinking styles but understanding one's own thinking style is also very important. This will help you work with teams, understand how you learn and how you don't so you can maximize your learning.</p>

            <p>After researching my thinking style I learned that Abstract Sequential thinkers are described by Gregorc as the following:</p>

            <p><b>Abstract Sequential learners like:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>his/her point to be heard</li>
                <li>analyzing situations before making a decision or acting</li>
                <li>applying logic in solving or finding solutions to problems</li>
            </ul>
            <p>They learn best when:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>they have access to experts or references</li>
                <li>placed in stimulating environments</li>
                <li>able to work alone</li>
            </ul>
            <p>What's hard for them?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Being forced to work with those of differing views</li>
                <li>Too little time to deal with a subject thoroughly</li>
                <li>Repeating the same tasks over and over</li>
                <li>Lots of specific rules and regulations</li>
                <li>"sentimental" thinking</li>
                <li>Expressing their emotions</li>
                <li>Being diplomatic when convincing others</li>
                <li>Not monopolizing a conversation</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Concrete Random learners like:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>experimenting to find answers</li>
                <li>take risks</li>
                <li>use their intuition</li>
                <li>solving problems independently</li>
            </ul>
            <p>They learn best when:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>they are able to use trial-and-error approaches</li>
                <li>able to compete with others</li>
                <li>given the opportunity to work through the problems by themselves.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>What's hard for them?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Restrictions and limitations</li>
                <li>Formal reports</li>
                <li>Routines</li>
                <li>Re-doing anything once it’s done</li>
                <li>Keeping detailed records</li>
                <li>Showing how they got an answer</li>
                <li>Choosing only one answer</li>
                <li>Having no options</li>
            </ul>

            <p>While my thinking style is described as the above I also think I can learn from what I am not.</p>
            <p><b>Concrete Sequential learners like:</b></p>

                <li>following directions, predictability</li>
                <li>getting facts</li>
            </ul>
            <p>They learn best when:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>they have a structured environment</li>
                <li>they can rely on others to complete this task</li>
                <li>are faced with predictable situations</li>
                <li>can apply ideas in pragmatic ways</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Working in groups</li>
                <li>Discussions that seem to have no specific point</li>
                <li>Working in an unorganized environment</li>
                <li>Following incomplete or unclear directions</li>
                <li>Working with unpredictable people</li>
                <li>Dealing with abstract ideas</li>
                <li>Demands to "use your imagination"</li>
                <li>Questions with no right or wrong answers</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Abstract Random learners like:</p></b>
