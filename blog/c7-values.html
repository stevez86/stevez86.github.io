            <h2>My Integrity</h2>
            <p><i>Friday, October 31st, 2014</i></p>

            <p>For this week's cultural blog, I decided to write about a personal value that is very important to me. There are many values that people can have and I think there are many values that are important to me as a person, therefore picking one was not easy. For this blog, I chose to write about integrity. Integrity to me, is how you set the standard for yourself when others are not around. I think it can apply in general to a lot of different values which is why I chose it. Because of this I think it's one of the most important values one can have. I think problems arise for cultures and sub cultures when people lose integrity. It results in society creating rules and punishments for breaking those rules. Lacking integrity undermines society and can be damaging.</p>

            <p>On a personal level, I think doing your best and doing what's right, while subjective, is the most important thing one can do. If you have a good integrity you can always know in your heart that what you did is right and feel good about yourself even when others are not around to acknowledge it. Doing the right thing everyday is what I strive to do in everything I do and that's why I value integrity in people and in myself.</p>
