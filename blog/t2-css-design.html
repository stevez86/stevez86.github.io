            <h2>Webpage Basics: Content, Padding, Border and Margins</h2>
            <p><i>Sunday, September 28th, 2014</i></p>
            <p>For this week's technical blog entry, I decided to write about margin, padding and borders. These tools are used when styling your website, generally used in a CSS style sheet and are a very important as every webpage is built with these tools and give a website and it's elements it's structure and framework. They help set the spacing of each object on a webpage.</p>
            <p>Margin, padding and borders are used to describe the area around an element. In HTML, all elements are considered boxes as they are either a square or rectangle. This includes, text, pictures, tables, etc. For example a line of text would be the content of the element. Beyond the content is another (usually invisible) space called the padding, adding padding to the object actually changes the size of the element. Beyond the padding is the border, whcih can be blank or stlyed however you want. Beyond the border of the object is the margin. The margin is like padding however it relates to how elements are spaced between each other. All of these items can have any width including no width at all!</p>
            <p>So the next time you're on a webpage, (hint: you're reading this on one) look at the elements and visualize every item on the webpage in a content box. A developer chooses each item's padding, borders and margins so that everything looks nice to the reader. The developer's recipe is then formtted by the browser into the nice webpage you see. Utilizing margin, padding and borders are very important, they can be tricky but allow you to build a website.</p>
