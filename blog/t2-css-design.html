            <h2>Back to Basics: Content, Padding, Border and Margins!</h2>
            <p>9/28/14</p>
            <p>For this week's technical aspect, I've been tasked with blogging about margin, padding and borders when it comes to HTML. This is a very important topic as every object on any webpage is governed by this. The terms are used to describe the area around an element. In HTML, all elements are considered boxes as they are either a square or rectangle. This includes, text, pictures, tables, etc. For example a line of text would be the content of the element. Following the content is another box that includes the padding. Around the padding is the border and then followed by the margin. All of these items can have any width including no width at all!</p>
            <p>So the next time you are on a webpage, (hint: you're reading this on one) look at the items and visualize every item on the webpage in a content box. A developer then chooses various padding, borders and margins so that everything looks nice to the reader.</p>
            <p>Thanks for reading. Steve Z, signing out!</p>
