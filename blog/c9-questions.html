            <h2>How to ask a good question</h2>
            <p><i>Tuesday, November 11th, 2014</i></p>
            <p>For this week's cultural blog, I decided to write about how to ask a good questions. Asking questions are important in learning and there are some important ways and things to keep in mind when asking anyone, including your peers, teachers or the retail employee at some business. Asking good questions are vital to good communication adn benefit all parties involved.</p>

            <p>If you break it down, good questions are clear and concise to the reader. Every good questions has a clear title, context and problem statement. By clear, I mean that it's obvious what you are asking and it's clear to the person you are asking. The golden rule is to imagine yourself as the person receiving the questions. Do they have all the information they need to asnwer the question? Is the right question even being asked? These are important things to consider when asking questions.</p>

            <p>When asking a question through email, the first thing people notice are the spelling and grammar mistakes. These will easily distract the person answering the question and leave a bad impression that may lead the person elsewhere or unintereseted in responding. Make sure you take the time to think about the question, phrase it correctly with proper grammar and spelling.</p>

            <p>The context of a questions is very important. What language (if it's programming), how can I recreate the problem? What other circumstantial details are pertinent for the question to be answered. In terms of web developing it may be important to mention the technologies being used, the things you've tried up to this point. These are things that you need to include in order to get the question answered effectively without wasting the time of the person being asked.</p>

            <p>Overall, the golden rule is to put yourself in the shoes of the person being asked and not make any assumptions about what the receiver knows. Also make sure you have a clear and concise context and problem statement. If these things are provided then you are well on your way to asking a good question.</p>
