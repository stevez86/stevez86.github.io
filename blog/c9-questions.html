            <h2>How to ask a good question</h2>
            <p><i>Tuesday, November 11th, 2014</i></p>
            <p>For this week's cultural blog, I've been tasked with researching, how to ask good questions. Asking questions are important in learning and there are some important ways and things to keep in mind when asking anyone, including your peers, teachers or the retail employee at the Apple Store. Asking good questions are vital to good communication.</p>

            <p>If you break it down good questions are clear and concise to the reader. Every good questions has a clear title, context and problem statement. By clear, I mean that it's obvious what you are asking and it's clear to the person you are asking. The golden rule is to imagine yourself as the person receiving the questions. Do they have all the information they need to asnwer the question. Is the question even being asked? These are important thigns to consider when asking questions.</p>

            <p>The first thing that people notice are spelling and grammar. These will easily distract the person answering the question and leave a bad impression that may lead that person elsewhere. Make sure you phrase it correctly with proper grammar and spelling.</p>

            <p>The context of a questions is very important. What language (if it's programming), how can I recreate the problem? What other circumstantial details are pertinent for the question to be answered. These are things that you need to include in order to get the question answered effectively without wasting the time of the person being asked. Usually it's important to include details to provide a clear context to he person being asked.</p>

            <p>Overall, the golden rule is to put yourself in the shoes of the person being asked, make sure you have a clear and concise context and problem statement. If these things are provided then you are well on your way to asking a good question.</p>
